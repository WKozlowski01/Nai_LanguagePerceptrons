In the preparation of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans,[1] kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, lima beans and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod.[2] Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip.[3] Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used,[2] as are prepared canned beans and refried beans.[4][5] The use of canned beans can result in a creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure-cooked in the can.[4] Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them.[6] Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans.[7] Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.[8]

Prepared dried bean flakes can also be used in the dish's preparation.[9] The bean flakes are reconstituted into a bean paste using boiling water,[9] and can be used to create an instant or quick bean dip.[10][11] The use of dried bean flakes can contribute to a bean dip with a creamy and smooth texture.[12]

Many additional ingredients can be used, including onion, roasted red bell pepper, red and green chili peppers, cilantro, lime, lime juice and lime zest, lemon juice, sour cream, oil, lard, vinegar, water, and spices such as garlic, cumin, coriander, chili powder and cayenne, hot sauce, salt and pepper.[1][2][3][4][5][13][14][15] The various ingredients can be mixed or pur√©ed together using a food processor,[1][4] a blender, or by hand. Bean dip is sometimes topped with shredded cheese[2] and garnished with ingredients such as chopped cilantro, chopped green onion, chopped fresh or dried parsley and lime zest, among others.[1][4][16][17]
