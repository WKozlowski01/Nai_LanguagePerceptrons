The Keweenaw Brewing Company opened in 2004. It was founded by Paul Boissevain and Richard Grey, who previously worked at the same oil company in Denver, Colorado, and lost their jobs around the same time.[1] Keweenaw was the second modern microbrewery in the Upper Peninsula, after Hereford & Hops Steakhouse and Brewpub, and opened over three decades after Houghton's last brewery (Bosch) closed in 1973.[2][A]

Located on Shelden Street in Houghton's downtown, Keweenaw quickly became financially successful. In the first year after opening, the brewery brewed 400 barrels of beer and took over a storefront next door.[5][6] In the following year, they brewed 1,100 barrels, and within three years of opening, they added a deck with parking options and were producing 2,000 barrels.[5][6]

In 2007, the brewpub expanded its production capabilities by purchasing a warehouse in South Range, Michigan, located just to the south of Houghton, and installing brewing and canning equipment within it.[3][7][B] They began canning their beer that same year,[8] putting Keweenaw in the vanguard of widespread canning of craft beer in the United States.[9][10] As of 2022, the brewery sold its products in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas.[11]

By 2013, all of the taproom's employees were students at nearby Michigan Technological University,[8] and the brewery's existence was used as a selling point in attracting employees to the college.[12] Keweenaw canned their one thousandth batch of beer in March 2018,[13] and in the same year the brewing company signed a deal with Comerica Park, the stadium that hosts baseball's Detroit Tigers, to distribute their beer.[14] During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Keweenaw Brewing Company was awarded $15,000 from the Pure Michigan Small Business Relief Initiative.[15]

In 2024, Keweenaw celebrated their twentieth year in business.[16] Boissevain retired and sold his share of the business to his partner Grey, who in turn brought on his son and son-in-law as co-owners.[17]
