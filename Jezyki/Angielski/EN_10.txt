Modern agriculture employs techniques such as progeny testing to speed selective breeding, allowing the rapid acquisition of the qualities desired by meat producers.[9] For instance, in the wake of well-publicized health concerns associated with saturated fats in the 1980s, the fat content of United Kingdom beef, pork and lamb fell from 20–26 percent to 4–8 percent within a few decades, due to both selective breeding for leanness and changed methods of butchery.[9] Methods of genetic engineering that could improve the meat-producing qualities of animals are becoming available.[9]

Meat production continues to be shaped by the demands of customers. The trend towards selling meat in pre-packaged cuts has increased the demand for larger breeds of cattle, better suited to producing such cuts.[9] Animals not previously exploited for their meat are now being farmed, including mammals such as antelope, zebra, water buffalo and camel,[9] as well as non-mammals, such as crocodile, emu and ostrich.[9] Organic farming supports an increasing demand for meat produced to that standard.[10]
