Bob Fluet and Rob Hynds founded the Boxers NYC chain in 2010, when they opened the brand's flagship venue in Chelsea, Manhattan.[2] Throughout the 2010s, the business expanded within New York City, including into Hell's Kitchen and the Upper East Side, as well as into Center City, Philadelphia.[3] In March 2018, the chain was approved for a 15-year lease on a new location in Washington Heights; it opened on September 14, 2018.[3][6][7] At that time, Boxers WaHi was the only gay bar in that neighborhood, which had been without such a venue since 2014.[3][6] Fluet and Hynds selected Washington Heights because the area was "increasingly popular among New York City's millennial and LGBTQ residents, [but it was not] yet known for businesses that service these groups".[6]

A September 2018 article in Instinct magazine questioned whether the bar's arrival would contribute to gentrification and displacement of the local Dominican community.[3] Hynds stated that Boxers WaHi would be welcoming to all demographics, that it had hired a diverse staff, and that it would feature events appealing to different audiences.[3][6] Some locals expressed concern that Boxers WaHi's presence would make the area more attractive to businesses and drive up the cost of rent. The local community board nevertheless approved the bar's application without much opposition, and the venue's soft opening on September 10, 2018, attracted a crowd of hundreds.[6]

Hynds and a number of local drag queens noted that because New York City no longer had a single, centralized gay scene, it was possible that Washington Heights would soon become a hotspot for that community. Mon√©t X Change, a resident of the Bronx nearby, stated: "There are new gay bars being built up in Washington Heights and Harlem. So, I feel like soon [the gay scene is] going to transition to the Upper West Side and Harlem."[6]
