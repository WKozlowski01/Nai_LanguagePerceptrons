Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[20] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[20] Newly-hatched chicks of both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage chicken of the same age.[22]

Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[23]

Chickens are omnivores.[24] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[25] and young mice.[26] A chicken may live for 5â€“10 years, depending on the breed.[27] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[28]

Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. Individual chickens dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and nest sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the "pecking order".[29][30] Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts.[31] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young fox.[32]
