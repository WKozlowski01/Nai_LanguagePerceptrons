Snow White[2][9] is a 2025 American musical fantasy film directed by Marc Webb and written by Erin Cressida Wilson.[1] Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Marc Platt Productions, it is a live-action reimagining[10][11] of Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. That animated film was based on the 1812 fairy tale "Snow White" by the Brothers Grimm. Starring Rachel Zegler, Andrew Burnap and Gal Gadot, the new film follows the pure-hearted Snow White (Zegler) who joins forces with seven dwarfs and a bandit named Jonathan (Burnap) to free her kingdom from her cruel stepmother (Gadot).

Plans for a remake of 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were confirmed in October 2016, with Wilson announced as a screenwriter. Webb entered talks to direct in May 2019 and was announced as director in September 2019. Filming took place primarily in London from March to July 2022, with additional filming and pick-ups in June 2024. With an estimated production budget of $240–270 million, Snow White is one of the most expensive films ever made and Disney's fifteenth-most expensive. Before release, controversies arose about the film related to its color-blind casting, story changes, Zegler's public critiques of the original film, Zegler and Gadot's conflicting political views, and the reimagining of the Seven Dwarfs.

Snow White premiered at Alcázar of Segovia in Segovia, Spain, on March 12, 2025, and was released in the United States by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on March 21, 2025. It received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $142.8 million worldwide.
